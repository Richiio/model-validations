# model-validations
This repository contains model validations for the Ersilia Model Hub.

## Repository structure
The /data folder contains general datasets used across all models, as well as predictions obtained using these datasets. The /notebooks folder contains the analysis of that data.

Models are grouped by activity of interest. For example, the /hERG folder will contain model validations specifically for models predicting hERG activity. This includes performance validations using external datasets as well as reproducibility of existing results reported in the original publication. 

## Data
Data for model testing comes from ChEMBL and Coconut, and specific model performance validation datasets are manually curated from well-described datasets like the Therapeutics Data Commons or MoleculeNet.
